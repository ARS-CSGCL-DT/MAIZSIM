Light is input in the weather module and converted to Watts m-2 as HSR()

HSR(M)=max(0.0,climat(1))*BSOLAR/3600
BSOLAR converts radiation to MJ m2, then the 3600 converts to Watts m-2

RI is translated to MJ m-2
 RI = RI + amax1(0.0,HSR(M))*3600

PAR is calculated as  0.43 DIRECT + 0.57 DIFFUSE RADIATION.
           PAR(I) = WATTSM(I)
     &          *((DIFWAT(I)*0.57) + ((1.0 - DIFWAT(I))*0.43))
It is in units of Watts

In the crop module watts are converted to umol s-1 m-2
wthr.PFD = Weather->par[time_public->iTime-1]*4.6; // conversion from PAR in Wm-2 to umol s-1 m-2

SolRad in the plant module is in Watts
wthr.solRad = Weather->WATTSM[time_public->iTime-1]
